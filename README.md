# Read News

Web Version of [News Feed App](https://github.com/AnuragThePathak/News-Feed-App).

- Read News is a web app that fetches news from various news sources and displays them on a web page.
- You will get news of total 7 categories which are Business, Entertainment, General, Health, Science, Sports, Technology.
- It uses a [News API](https://github.com/SauravKanchan/NewsAPI) to fetch news.
- It uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to render the news.
- It uses [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) to style the news.
- It is deployed on [Netlify](https://read-news.netlify.app/).
- At this moment, you will be getting one set of news per day due to limitations of the News API, but I am planning to start developing an API myself within a few months.
